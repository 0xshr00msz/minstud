          For centuries, the Bukidnon people, also called "Buquidnons," have lived along the northern Pulangi River and the Tagoloan and Cagayan Rivers. These are proud and resilient forest dwellers, bound by their heritage and deep connection to the land.

        <h2>A Glimpse into Bukidnon's History</h2>
        <p>
          In 1889, the population of Bukidnon was estimated at 13,000. These communities lived in "tulugan"â€”small tribal groups governed by a datu. Each tulugan was a tightly knit community, led by a central datu or elder. The datus were not only leaders but keepers of the epic Ulaguing, which they sang during gatherings, telling stories of their people's past.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Spanish arrived in the 1860s, bringing Jesuit missionaries who established the first parish in Sumilao in 1880. By the early 1900s, many Bukidnons had converted to Christianity while retaining elements of their animist beliefs. This blend of old and new shaped Bukidnon's spiritual identity.

        <h2>Beliefs of the Bukidnon Tribes</h2>
        <p>
          Central to Bukidnon's identity is its connection to nature and spirituality. The tribes believe in four gods, each representing a direction:
        </p>
        <div className="list" id="beliefs">
          <div>Domalongdong (North)</div>
          <div>Ongli (South)</div>
          <div>Tagolambong (East)</div>
          <div>Magbabaya (West)</div>
        </div>
        <p>
          These deities guide and protect their people, symbolizing the harmony between the tribes and the natural world.
